!The set of protein accessions included in this file is based on UniProt reference proteomes, which provide one protein per gene.
!They include the protein sequences annotated in Swiss-Prot or the longest TrEMBL transcript if there is no Swiss-Prot record.
!If a particular protein accession is not annotated with GO, then it will not appear in this file.
!
!Note that the annotation set in this file is filtered in order to reduce redundancy; the full, unfiltered set can be found in
